Graphics Form

A project which allows me to create a new version of the graphics form while learning AngularJs 1.3.

After working on Angular project with Geodan, and following a course by Trifork, I started to read the book
'AngularJs, Up and Running.' While reading the book linearly, I gradually applied the practices from the book
into this project.
